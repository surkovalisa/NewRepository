You know when
I was a little kidAll
I ever wanted to
It's make something bigger outta my life
And I been forgotten like the rest
So check it!

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Humble beginnings in a fight to the finish
Hangin' on with a grimace
Giveth the look of God
When told faith is fraud
Cause you gave it all you had
So why won't they applaud?
Wrong again!
Bitter sweet
Hard to stomach if you love it
Not a friend
But a puppet with strings attached
Dance to the beat
Of a dying heart
Change your pace
Cause if I keep on moving
I might find a way

I'm alive
I'll give you all my time (I'll find a way, I'll find a way)
I'll put it all on the line, hey
Find a way to the light
Why's there gotta be a test on every breath I'm holding to make

I'll find a way for youâ€¦
